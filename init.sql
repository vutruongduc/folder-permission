-- Database initialization script for Docker container
-- This script runs when the PostgreSQL container starts for the first time

-- Create the database if it doesn't exist
-- Note: The database is already created by POSTGRES_DB environment variable
-- This script is for any additional setup

-- You can add any initial data or additional setup here
-- For example:
-- INSERT INTO teams (name) VALUES ('Default Team');
-- INSERT INTO team_folders (team_id, folder_path) VALUES (1, '/default');

-- For now, the database will be empty and will be initialized by the application
